# Robojudge
A machine learning project to give feedback on presentation skills for students

# RUNNING THE SCRIPT:

This script uses python 3.6. The dependencies for the main project are Flask, google.cloud, pyaudio, six, stringdist, and ibm_watson. All of the dependencies can be installed using PyPi. Make sure you also have an api for both google cloud services and IBM Watson (both have a free way to access their APIs)

# ABOUT THE FILES

The ML_Basics folder contains my learnings of machine learning using Tensorflow. 

The TextEmotions folder contains the main project. Static and template holds the HTML and CSS used to create the website UI for this project. Goog-s2t.py has an infinite live speech to text translator. speechToTextTest and textEmotionTest are both tests of the APIs I used in this project. watsonTextEmotion has the main python script for this project.
